# Imports
This is where the spigot jar file are that we use as dependencies. These files are for 1.12.2 and below for storing and getting NBT data.

## Jar Files in this folder:
- spigot-1.8.jar
- spigot-1.9.4.jar
- spigot-1.10.2.jar
- spigot-1.11.2.jar
- spigot-1.12.2.jar

## How to Obtain these Jars
These jar files are obtained from spigotmc.com from Buildtools. You can get each of them by running the BuildTools.jar file from command prompt or powershell and adding --rev <version> to get the specific version. Example: (java -jar BuildTools.jar --rev 1.12.2 (downloads spigot 1.12.2 jar)).
You can find the BuildTools.jar file here: https://hub.spigotmc.org/jenkins/job/BuildTools/

I will not put the spigot jar files in here for multiple reasons:
- The fact that they are quite large and I do not believe it is needed to add it all in here as you can just get them from buildtools.
- The versions that you get from buildtools will be the most up to date versions of the jar files. I do not want to have to update these jars myself everytime.
- Because what has happened you cannot technically distribute the jars themseleves legally, you must get them from buildtools.jar.
