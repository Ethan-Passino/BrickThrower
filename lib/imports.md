# Imports
This is where the spigot jar file dependencies are. They are in here because we need to import them to add support for older versions of minecraft. 

## Jar Files in this folder:
- spigot-1.8.jar
- spigot-1.9.4.jar
- spigot-1.10.2.jar
- spigot-1.11.2.jar
- spigot-1.12.2.jar
- spigot-1.13.2.jar

I will not be putting them in here for two reasons. One the fact that they are quite large and I do not believe it is needed to add it all in here.
Two it technically would be illegal.
